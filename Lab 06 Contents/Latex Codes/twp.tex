\section*{Lecture Summaries}
\subsection*{Concept of Almighty, Morality, Ethics, and Soulful Prayer}
The concept of the Almighty refers to a supreme being or higher power believed to govern the universe. This belief often provides moral guidance: it encourages individuals to adopt ethical behaviours such as honesty, compassion, patience, and self-discipline. Soulful prayer acts as a personal connection between an individual and the higher power; through sincere prayer people find inner peace, strength during hardships, and motivation to act morally. In classroom discussion, emphasis was placed on how faith can cultivate social harmony and personal integrity.

\subsection*{The \$5000 Diet Plan and Video Content on Diet}
A \$5000 diet plan is an example of an expensive, sometimes elite approach to nutrition that promises premium food, consultation, and specialized meal preparation. However, the underlying message is that a healthy diet is an investment in long-term wellbeing rather than a mere expense. Video content about diet (available on social platforms) serves as an accessible source of information and practical guidance: meal preparation tutorials, calorie management tips, and lifestyle advice. Students were encouraged to evaluate such content critically and to prioritise evidence-based, affordable practices.

\subsection*{Mediterranean Diet and Secret Tips to Stay Young}
The Mediterranean diet emphasises olive oil, fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish, and moderate dairy. It is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, improved cognitive health, and greater longevity. ``Secret'' tips to remain youthful are not mystical; they are practical habits: balanced nutrition, adequate hydration, regular physical activity, sufficient sleep, stress management, and maintaining positive social relationships.

\subsection*{The Four Keys to Shine}
The four keys identified in lecture are: discipline, hard work, positive thinking, and self-confidence. Discipline structures daily efforts; hard work turns goals into accomplishments; positive thinking helps to maintain motivation and resilience; and self-confidence enables action under uncertainty. Together these attributes support academic success and personal development.

\section*{Model Answers for Test Questions}
Below are compact, practice-ready answers. Students should practice delivering each answer in approximately 1--2 minutes for speaking tests.

\subsection*{Q1: Faith in the Almighty and the Idea of a Higher Power}
\textbf{Question:} Most people have faith in Almighty God; they also think that there is a higher power controlling the world. Give your opinion.\\
\textbf{Model Answer (Speech-style):}\\
I believe that the idea of an Almighty being — or a higher power — provides a sense of order and meaning in life. When we observe natural rhythms, complex biological systems, and the moral instincts found in many cultures, it is natural for people to form a belief in something greater than themselves. Faith often supports ethical behaviour and provides comfort during difficulties. Soulful prayer can calm the mind and strengthen resolve to act morally. However, belief should coexist with reason: faith inspires virtue, while reason helps us apply those values practically. In short, faith in the Almighty is a valuable source of moral guidance and psychological strength for many people.

\subsection*{Q2: Responsibility for Health and Diet}
\textbf{Question:} Some people believe it is the responsibility of individuals to take care of their own health and diet. Others believe governments should make sure citizens have a healthy diet. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\\
\textbf{Model Answer (Essay/Speech-style):}\\
I believe that responsibility for health and diet is shared between individuals and governments. Individuals must make day-to-day choices: selecting balanced meals, avoiding excessive fast food, and exercising regularly. Personal discipline matters because no policy can force someone to adopt healthy habits. At the same time, governments have a duty to create conditions that make healthy choices available and affordable. This includes public health campaigns, school nutrition programmes, regulation of harmful ingredients, and subsidies for fresh produce. For example, promoting Mediterranean-style dietary options and clear food labeling can help citizens choose better diets. Combining personal responsibility with supportive public policy produces the best outcomes for population health.

\subsection*{Q3: Traditional Food Replaced by International Fast Food}
\textbf{Question:} In many countries, traditional foods are being replaced by international fast food. This is having a negative effect on both families and societies. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\\
\textbf{Model Answer (Opinion-style):}\\
I largely agree that the rise of international fast food has negative consequences for families and societies. Traditional cuisine forms an essential part of cultural identity and family life; preparing and sharing home-cooked meals fosters family bonds and transmits cultural values. Fast food is convenient but often high in fat, salt, and sugar, contributing to obesity and other health problems. The shift away from home-cooked foods can weaken family mealtimes and cultural continuity. That said, fast food meets the demands of busy modern lifestyles, so the solution lies in balance: protecting and promoting traditional foods while acknowledging modern needs.

\section*{Practical Tips for Speaking Test Preparation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Practice each model answer aloud for timing and fluency (aim 1--2 minutes per answer).
  \item Record yourself and listen for clarity, pace, and pronunciation.
  \item Use short, natural linking words (e.g., ``however,'' ``for example,'' ``in conclusion'').
  \item Keep a calm posture and maintain eye contact (if the test is live).
  \item Learn one or two relevant examples (e.g., Mediterranean diet components or a public policy idea) to support your answers.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}
This report collects lecture highlights and model responses to likely examination questions. Students who internalise these points, practise speaking them naturally, and adapt the answers with personal examples will be well prepared for the speaking test.
